1. Tell me about yourself = 3mins 
   who are you as regards this position 
   How do you fit in the picture 

2. Describe the project you are currently managing = 3mins  
   a. AMAZON eks custer using terraform/console/CLI  
       -  other AWS services/resources  
       -  VPC and its components
       -  EC2 instances / Serverless Farget / ebs / efs / RDS/S3 
       -  asg / LT / LC / ELB / 
       -  IAM   
       -  terraform init/validate/fmt/plan/apply/destroy/import
                    output/kubeconfig   
                    terraformstate.tf  

   b. I provision and manage resources using the console & CLI   
      & most importantly IaC with terraform/
      - I write and modify terraform modules/scripts 
      - i make use modules & variables to create reusable codes
      - I also manage the terraform workflow in my environment  
        terraform init/validate/fmt/plan/apply/destroy/import/refresh   
      - with same terraform script i provision resources in dev/test/prod

  demovpc: 10.0.0.0/16   -- IaC  
    sn1:   10.0.0.0/24   -- IaC
    sn2:   10.0.1.0/24   -- IaC 
    sn3:   10.0.2.0/24   -- created from the console  
    demoServer  = t2.micro  - -- IaC  
    demoServer is changed from t2.micro to t2.xlarge - -- console  
    terraform refresh  
  verify: cat terraformstate / terraform show  / console  
 
 c. migrating/importing fully to IaC with terraform  

 d.- containerisation of applications using docker   
      - I'm task to install docker and kubernetes in ubuntu servers 
      - I containerised applications by:
         - writing and modifying dockerfiles using best practices
         - use ONLY Official images for base images   
         - Reduce the number of RUN keyword to create light weight images 
           because it add layers to your image and the final image size. 
         - use executable form over shell form for CMD,ENTRYPOINT
           & RUN Instructions for the application process to run as parent 
         - Use alpine images as much as possible   
         - scan images before use  
         - .dockerignore file. 
      - creating and sharing images in registry - dockerhub/nexus

  e: orchestrating/managing containerised applications using kubernetes
     - container mgt using kubernetes 
     - writing and modifying kubernetes manifest files  
     - managing the kubernetes Infrastructure/architecture
        controlPlane workernodes  
     - Setting-up a multi-nodes self Managed k8s using kubeadm, kops
       Setting-up a multi-nodes  Managed k8s using eks
     - application mgt:
        1. deploying stateless applications using controllerMgers
        deployment, RS, CM, Secrets /      
        2. deploying stateful applications using controllerMgers
           statefulsets, RS, CM, Secrets, PV, PVC, SC, /  
        3. deploying monitoring applications like Prometheus/Grafana, EFK
           DS, RS, deployments,CM, Secrets, PV, PVC, SC, / 
        4. using helm package to deploy+mgt applications     
     -  5. exposing applications to endUsers using serviceDiscovery
           ClusterIP, NodePort, LB, ExternalName , ingress  / 
           NetworkPolicy
  f. Troubleshooting kubernetes related problems
     - Node = failed nodes /CPU/mem/ OOM Killed / 
     - pod  = pods pending / slow starting pod / wrong image/imageTag
     -        short lifecycle / not a controllerMger
     - manifest problem:
        POD labels not matching controllerMgers selectors  
        POD labels not matching service selectors
           - writing jenkins pipelines scripts for ci/cd automation  
        syntax issues   

   - managing and granting access into aws services  
   - deploying aws services using terraform   
   - migrating from monolithic to microservices architecture/design  
   - Setting up a kubernetes cluster using KOPS
       walk-in through your KOPS kubernetes cluster setup. 
     1. kops is a software that permit us to deploy a production ready kubernetes cluster
        in aws and other cloud platforms.

          kops create cluster --$NAME
             create a VPC with all components  
             CREATES ASGs for workernodes and masterNodes   
             create ELB for the apiServer 
             create launch templates for workernodes and masterNodes     
             create workernodes and masterNodes 
             it creates dynamic storage classes  
             uses S3 as a kopsStateStore      

        IAM = IAM user/roles/groups/policy  

   - managing artifacts using nexus  
       walk-in through your artifacts mgt with nexus  
   - jar/war/ear, npm, dockerIamages

   - writing and modifying ansible playbooks & roles for 
     fileMGT/userMGT/packageMGT/deploymentMGT/securityMGT
   - writing and modifying dockerfile, docker-compose files
     creating and sharing docker images using best pactices  
   - writing and modifying Jenkinsfiles and Jenkins shares libraries
   - deploying APM tools like NeWRelic, Prometheus/Grafana using helm
   - preparing detail documentations 
   - morning devotion   

  3. how are java web applications deployed?                     :
        1. tomcat or JBoss server   
        2. as docker containers using docker   
        3. as containers using kubernetes   


3a. what problems have you faced in kubernetes and how did you resolve them
3b. explain a problem you faced in your project and the steps you took to resolve it.
